# About

Welcome to my knowledge management system! This is where I collect and share notes from my daily readings, along with my thoughts and reflections.

## What This Is

This site serves as my personal knowledge repository where:

- I document notes from articles and books I read
- Share my thoughts and comments on various topics
- Build connections between different ideas using Obsidian-style [[wikilinks]]

## The Collaborative Process

I work together with Claude Code (Claudia) to organize this knowledge:

- I write the content - my thoughts, comments, and quotations remain exactly as I write them
- Claudia helps categorize and organize the content into topics
- Together we build a web of interconnected ideas

## How It Works

1. **Daily Notes**: I create blog posts with my reading notes and reflections
2. **Topic Extraction**: Common themes are identified and organized into topic pages
3. **Cross-Linking**: Everything is connected using [[wikilinks]] for easy navigation
4. **Continuous Growth**: The knowledge base evolves as I read and think more

## Technical Foundation

This system is built on:

- **Obsidian** for note-taking with wikilinks
- **MkDocs** with Material theme for a beautiful web interface
- **GitHub Actions** for automatic deployment
- **Modern Python tooling** with uv for reliability

Feel free to explore and follow along as this knowledge garden grows!
